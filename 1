################### List the steps used in Creation of AWS RDS (data base ) server along with screen shots

Steps Used in Creation of Relational Database Service server


1.  Launching RDS
2.  Creating database and choosing database method

3.  Choosing the engine and its version

For example choosing MySQL and its default version

4.  Choosing template and deployment options

Since we using the free tier, the availability and durability options are not there, the deployment options offer backups in various availability zones
Configuring settings such as specifying database details such as cluster identifier, username, credentials management etc
6.  Configuring the instance

Choosing the DB instance type that allocates the computational, network, and memory capacity required by planned workloads of this DB instance.
7.  Using the default storage settings for the database
8.  Configuring the advance settings
Such as selecting the VPC where we want to launch the RDS instance,then choosing the subnet group that defines the subnets for RDS instance.
Specifying whether the database instance should be publicly accessible over the internet or no, configuring security group settings to control access to the RDS instance. And setting additional database options such as parameter groups, backup retention, monitoring, etc.
Optional to add tags for easy identification and authentication, once done click on “create database”

 Listthe steps used in creation of VPC in AWS along with screenshots and proper writeup on CIDR Notation.


Steps Used in Creation of VPC in AWS with write up on CIDR Notation

1. Launching the VPC dashboard

2. After clicking on create VPC > Adding “Name Tag” > CIDR block

(Specifying the CIDR block for your VPC. This is a range of IPv4 addresses in CIDR notation. For example, "10.0.0.0/16" represents a range of IP addresses from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.255.255.)

3. Choosing the number of availability zone
4.	Configuring the Subnet settings

After creating the VPC, you can create one or more subnets within it. Subnets are segments of the VPC's IP address range where you can place your resources.
5. NAT and VPC endpoints

NAT gateways enable resources in private subnets to reach the internet. And VPC endpoints enable you to create an isolated VPC that is closed from the public internet.

6. Previewing and then clicking on “create vpc”

you can verify the creation of your VPC by navigating back to the VPC dashboard and ensuring that your newly created VPC is listed there.


CIDR Notation

CIDR notation is a way to describe a range of IP addresses in a compact and standardized format. It consists of two parts:
IP Address: An IP address is like a unique identifier for a device on a network. It's made up of four numbers separated by dots, like 10.0.0.0.
​

Subnet Mask: A subnet mask helps define which part of the IP address identifies the network and which part identifies the specific device on that network. It's typically a series of four numbers separated by dots, just like the IP address.

In CIDR notation, the subnet mask is represented differently. Instead of writing out the entire subnet mask, we simply write a number after a slash ("/"). This number tells us how many bits from the left of the IP address are used to represent the network. For example:

IP Address: 10.0.0.0

Subnet Mask: 255.255.0.0

In CIDR notation, this would be written as "10.0.0.0/16". The "/16" means that the first 16 bits of the IP address are used to represent the network, while the remaining bits can be used to identify individual devices within that network.
So, in simpler terms, CIDR notation is just a way of saying "this IP address belongs to this network, and here's how many devices can be on that network." It helps network administrators efficiently manage and organize IP addresses within a network.
