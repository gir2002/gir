****Demonstrate  basic DDL and DML statements********

show datbases;

create database xyzdb;

use xyzdb;

#####creating table

create table customer(ID int primary key,Name varchar(50) not null,age int not null);


#######shows the property of the columns and tables
desc customer; 

##### for inserting 
insert into customer values(123 ,"vidit",54);



###to show the table 

select*from customer;

#####to select particular columns 
select Id, Name from customer;


###using condition

select*from customer where age=53;

#####alter table (change modoify the columns characteristics)

alter table customer modify column age numeric(4);


*****Practical No 2*********

Aim: Demonstrate DML statements, Aggregate functions, OrderBy and Group By Operations

 create table studnet(Stud_id char(5) primary key, first_name varchar(
40) not null, last_name varchar(20) ,DOB date, Gender Varchar(1), Email_Id varchar(100));

create table teacher(Teach_id char(5) primary key, first_name varchar(40) not null, last_name varchar(20) ,DOB date, Gender Varchar(1), Email_Id varchar(100));

##Fees where receipt_no is primary key and stud_id is foreign key
 create table fees(Reciept_no int(6) primary key , Stud_id char(5) , amount char(18),foreign key (Stud_id) references Studnet(Stud_id));


1. Write a query to insert record of a new student ‘Cathy’ in student table

insert into student values(1,"Rahul","Khan","2001-09-13","M","rahul@gmail.com");


4. Write a query to update last name of teacher ‘Carol’ to ‘Pereira’ in the teacher
table

update teacher SET Lastname="pereira" where Firstname="carol";

5. Write a query to delete the record for the fee receipt ‘R3’

delete from fees where Reciept_no="R3";

6. Create a table StudCopy from the table Student, with student name and email id

create table StudentCopy AS select Firstname,Last name , email_id from Student;

7. Delete the table Fees from database

drop table fees;

*****************ORDERBY*******************(alphabetical Order)

select*from student order by DOB DESC;

select*from student order by DOB ASC;

***********GROUPBY***************

● Write a query to count how many employees work in each
department

select department , count(*) from employeetb group by department;

● Write a query to find maximum salary of employees in
each department

select department , max(salary) from employeetb groupby department;

● Write a query to find minimum salary of employees in
each department

select department , min(salary) from employeetb groupby department;

● Write a query to get total salary budget of every
department

select department , sum(salary) as total_salary_budget from employeetb groupby department;

**********AGGREGATE FUCTIONS***************

create table employees(Emp_Id int(9), emp_name varchar(20) , emp_sal
int(20));

insert into employees values(123 ,"Vidit",3987);

select*from employees;

1. Write a query to count total Employees in your table

select count(*)
Select count(*) from employees;

2. Write a query to count the employees having salary greater than 15000

Select count(*) from employees where empsalary>5000;


3. Write a query to count the unique names of your employees

Select count(distinct empname ) from employees;


4. Write a query to find maximum salary

select max(empsalary) from employees;

5. Write a query to find minimum salary

select min(empsalary) from employees;


6. Write a query to find average salary

select avg(empsalary) from employees;


7. Write a query to find total salary paid

select sum(empsalary) from employees;

Perform the following Join queries:
1. Demonstrate join operation

SELECt*from employeetable join departments on deptId=Did;

2. Demonstrate left outer join operation

SELECt*from employeetable left outer join departments on deptId=Did;

3. Demonstrate right outer join operation

SELECt*from employeetable right outer join departments on deptId=Did;

4. Demonstrate full join operation

SELECt*from employeetable full join departments on deptId=Did;

5. Demonstrate cross join operation

SELECt*from employeetable cross join departments on deptId=Did;


6. Write a query to display names of Employees who work in ‘IT’ Department
